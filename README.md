# Electroweak penguins and radiative B decays at Belle II

The repository contains the LaTeX source of proceedings of [the talk](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/29681/contributions/122493/attachments/76457/110969/09-CPraz-v1_rddbk.pdf) I gave on behalf of the Belle II collaboration at the Moriond conference:
* [C. Praz (on behalf of the Belle II collaboration), *Electroweak penguins and radiative B decays at Belle II*, Contribution to the 2023 Electroweak session of the 57th Rencontres de Moriond.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09939)

To compile the code, run `make` inside the repository.
